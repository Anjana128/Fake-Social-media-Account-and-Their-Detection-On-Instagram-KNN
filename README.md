Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Python. KNN is a simple, non-parametric, and supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

Features
#Implements the KNN algorithm from scratch.
#Supports classification tasks.
#Allows selection of different values of K.
#Includes data visualization and performance evaluation.


Installation
To run the KNN algorithm, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Alternatively, if using Jupyter Notebook, ensure all required libraries are installed before running the notebook.


Usage
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the repository:
cd your-repo
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook knn.ipynb
Run the cells sequentially to execute the KNN algorithm.



Example
Load a dataset (e.g., Iris dataset or any custom dataset)
Split the data into training and testing sets
Select the value of K
Train and evaluate the model
